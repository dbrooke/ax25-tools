Installation Instructions for AX.25 Tools
=========================================

To make these programs you will need the following:
	glibc2.1 (Debian 2.1.1-5 or RedHat glibc-2.1.2-3)
	A Modern kernel (2.2.x)
	libtool
	ax25-lib 0.0.5 or better
	zlib

To build it you type:
	./configure
	make
	make install

By default, it will install the files in /usr/local.  To change this
so that binaries go in  /usr and the conf files go in /etc 
	./configure --prefix=/usr  --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
	make
	make install

To install example configuration files type
	make installconf


While the configure script attempts to detect broken header files, it may
be that some slip through.  You can try to use the other header files by
editing config.h and changing the relevant lines to:

#undef HAVE_NETAX25_AX25_H
#undef HAVE_NETROM_NETROM_H
#undef HAVE_NETROSE_ROSE_H
