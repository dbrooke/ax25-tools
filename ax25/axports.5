.TH AXPORTS 5 "15 October 1996" Linux "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
axports \- AX.25 port configuration file.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Axports
is an ASCII file that contains information about each of the physical AX.25
ports that are to be used. When dealing with an AX.25 utility such as
.B call,
it takes an optional argument that is the port name. This port name is a
reference to the line within
.B axports,
which has that name as its first argument. The information on each line
contains enough information to bind the command to a particular physical AX.25
interface, this binding is done by matching the callsign on the line in
.B axports
with the callsign of the port set by
.B kissattach.
.LP
The lines within
.B axports
must either be a comment line, which starts with a # in the first column, or
a port description in the following format, each field being delimited by
white space:
.sp
