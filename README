AX25 Tools
==========

You are supposed to use glibc 2.1 (libc6 unstable libraries) for this
package.  I have attempted to cater for glibc 2.0 users here.

More specifically, it is recommended that you use a glibc newer than
2 May 1999, I believe Debian libc6 package 2.1.1-5 will do.

These tools were built on a Debian system, potato release, the libraries
are libc6 2.1.1-10, libax25 0.0.5 and ncurses 4.2-3.2.  Kernel is 2.2.10
