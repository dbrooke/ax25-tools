AX25 Tools
==========

THESE TOOLS ARE ALPHA CODE AND IS ONLY BEEN RELEASE FOR DEVELOPERS FOR
DEBUGGING.

This means if you are only installing this because it is the latest
and greatest and you don't understand how to diagnose bugs, then you
should probably not run it and go back to the ax25-utils-2*
packages.

You are supposed to use glibc 2.1 (libc6 unstable libraries) for this
package.  I have attempted to cater for glibc 2.0 users here.
